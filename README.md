## Creating a helpdesk ticket using a Slash Command and a Dialog

#### Enable Interactive Components
1. Go back to the app settings and click on Interactive Components.
1. Set the Request URL to your server (*e.g.* `https://yourname.ngrok.com`) or Glitch URL + `/interactive-component`

#### Run the app locally or [![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/slack-slash-command-and-dialogs-blueprint)
1. Get the code
    * Either clone this repo and run `npm install`
    * Or visit https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/slack-slash-command-and-dialogs-blueprint
2. Set the following environment variables to `.env` (see `.env.sample`):
    * `SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your app's `xoxa-` token (available on the ****OAuth & Permissions** once you install the app)
